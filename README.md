# EntityFramework-Master-detail
How to do a Master-Detail with Entity Framework almost without code, and how to consume an Entity Framework diagram from another project.
In this example, I'm demonstrating how to create a master-detail Windows Forms justing in a few clicks.
In addition, how to consume a data model in a different project.
There is a script to create the database and fill with some data (model.sql).

Technologies:
- Entity Framework 6.0
- Windows Forms
- Library Application
- SQL Server
